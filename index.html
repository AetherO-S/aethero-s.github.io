      <h2>Understanding Why Computers Slow Down</h2>
      <p>
        Over time, most computers experience performance degradation. This is
        rarely caused by failing hardware. Instead, it is usually the result of
        software accumulation, background services, unnecessary startup
        programs, and poor storage management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning how these issues develop makes it possible to restore speed and
        stability without replacing your system.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Startup and Background Process Optimization</h2>
      <p>
        Many applications configure themselves to launch automatically at
        startup. While convenient, excessive startup processes significantly
        increase boot times and memory usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disabling non-essential startup programs is one of the fastest ways to
        improve everyday system performance.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>System Updates and Driver Maintenance</h2>
      <p>
        Operating system updates often contain performance enhancements and
        security fixes. Running outdated software can introduce instability and
        compatibility issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hardware drivers, especially graphics drivers, should be kept current to
        ensure proper functionality and performance across modern applications.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Storage Management and Cleanup</h2>
      <p>
        Low available disk space can severely impact system speed. Temporary
        files, unused applications, and outdated installers often consume
        valuable storage without providing any benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Routine cleanup and proper storage configuration help maintain long-term
        system health.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>When Hardware Upgrades Are Justified</h2>
      <p>
        If optimization no longer yields noticeable improvements, targeted
        hardware upgrades may be appropriate. Adding system memory or upgrading
        to a solid-state drive can dramatically improve responsiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        These upgrades are often more cost-effective than purchasing a new
        system.
